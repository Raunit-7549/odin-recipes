    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chole Bhature is a legendary North Indian classic featuring a robust, spicy chickpea curry paired with deep-fried leavened bread. The chole are slow-cooked in a fragrant blend of cumin, coriander, and dried pomegranate seeds to achieve a dark, savory richness. This hearty dish is traditionally garnished with fresh ginger juliennes, green chilies, and a squeeze of tangy lemon.</p>
    <p>The bhature are golden-brown balloons of dough, prized for their crispy exterior and soft, airy interior that perfectly absorbs the gravy. Often served with a side of spicy mixed pickles, crunchy onions, and cooling mint chutney, it offers a symphony of textures. It remains the ultimate soul food for indulgent breakfasts, bustling street-side lunches, and festive family gatherings across India.</p>
