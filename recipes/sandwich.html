    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A classic vegetable sandwich is a celebration of freshness, layering crisp and colorful produce. Common ingredients like cucumber, tomato, and leafy greens provide a refreshing, crunchy base. It is often enhanced by creamy spreads like hummus or avocado to add richness and texture.</p>
    <p>The choice of bread, whether toasted sourdough or whole grain, provides a hearty and warm foundation. Balancing sweet peppers with sharp red onions creates a complex flavor profile in every bite. This versatile meal remains a popular choice for those seeking a light, nutritious, and vibrant dish.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Toasted multigrain bread</li>
        <li>Avocado or hummus spread</li>
        <li>Cucumber slices</li>
        <li>Red and yellow bell peppers</li>
        <li>Sliced red onion</li>
        <li>Zucchini ribbons</li>
        <li>Fresh spinach or arugula</li>
        <li>Tomato slices</li>
        <li>Balsamic glaze</li>
        <li>Salt and black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Toast two slices of multigrain bread until golden brown and firm. Generously coat one side of each slice with a creamy avocado spread or hummus. This layer acts as a moisture barrier and helps the vegetables stay in place.</li>
        <li>Place a bed of fresh spinach or arugula on the bottom slice of bread. Add a layer of cucumber slices followed by thin ribbons of zucchini. Stack the red and yellow bell peppers to give the sandwich height and color.</li>
        <li>Layer on the tomato slices and a few rings of red onion for a sharp bite. Drizzle a small amount of balsamic glaze over the vegetables for a tangy finish. Sprinkle with salt and black pepper before topping with the second slice of bread.</li>
    </ol>
